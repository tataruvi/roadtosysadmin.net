			<h4>Hello there.</h4>
			<p>My name is Ion, how do you do?</p>
			<p>The website was born out of a desire to preserve the results of some of the most fun moments I had during my only stint as a bonafide sysadmin (the position had a security focus but for all intents and purposes I was a Windows/VMware sysadmin), as well as to share them with the Internet at large, which did play an important role in getting the knowledge base style 'articles' created in the first place.</p>
			<p>These 'articles' represent some of my first, and hopefully not last, forays into the world of sysadmining. Some pedantry was thrown into the mix.</p>
			<p>I hope you'll enjoy them and might find them of some use, as I did with so many countless webpages on this amazing and expanding Internet.</p>
			<p><strong>*note:</strong> the website is not suited for access from a mobile device, I apologize for the inconvenience.</p>
