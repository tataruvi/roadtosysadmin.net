      <p><strong>About:</strong> The purpose of this document is to detail a problem that should rarely be encountered under normal
        circumstances (unlikely to manifest in non-highly restricted environment), but which is annoying enough, and
        difficult enough to troubleshoot, that it merits having its own dedicated page.</p>
      <p><strong>The problem and its context:</strong> Establishing an RDP connection takes some 15-20 seconds; that is, after the point
         were the credentials are provided to, and accepted by, the remote server and before being presented with the remote desktop session,
         during which time the RDP client's status messages are of the </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Securing remote session...</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>and </p>
      <blockquote>
      <p>Configuring remote session...</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>variety. Subsequent connections are slightly faster in establishing. The problem manifests in the context of the source system not
        having access to <em>update.microsoft.com</em> and the target server employing a self-signed certificate for securing its RDP connections
         - it turns out that, in such a situation, the source system will time-out attempting to contact <code>Windows Update</code>, to interrogate
         it about the existence of the "apparent CA" that has signed the target server's certificate, or perhaps to simply check if a newer variant of
         the Root CA store exists, which would possibly include this "new CA" (this appears to be a failure in logic on the part of the code
         responsible for the behaviour, as it does not capitalize on the difference between a self-signed certificate and one signed by an actual
         third party Certification Authority).</p>
      <p>For an exact description of the problem, see <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/2915774/remote-desktop-connection-is-sometimes-stuck-on-the-securing-remote-connection-screen">KB2915774</a>; for more details about the described mechanism, see this <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749331%28v=ws.10%29.aspx#BKMK_How">Technet article section</a>
        and this <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc734054%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">Technet description of the CAPI 2 source's EventID #8</a>.</p>
      <p><strong>Solution:</strong> The quick fix to the problem is to disable the mechanism responsible with interrogating Windows Update
        when encountering a certificate which cannot be validated based on the system's current <code>Root CA</code> store, which can be
        achieved by using the <code>Local Policy Editor (gpedit.msc)</code>, navigating to <code>Computer Configuration\Administrative Templates\System\Internet Communication Management\Internet Communication settings\Turn off Automatic Root Certificates Update</code>
        and enabling the policy in question.</p>
      <p><strong>Corollary:</strong> The proper fix for such an issue, especially in a production environment, is using certificates issued
        by a proper third party CA and making sure that the system initiating the connection has the CA's certificate(s) installed in its
        respective certificate store(s).</p>
