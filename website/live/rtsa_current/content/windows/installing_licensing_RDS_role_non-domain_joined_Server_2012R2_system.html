      <h3>Installing and licensing the RDS role on a non-domain joined Server 2012R2 system</h3>
      <p>System: Windows Server 2012R2</p>

      <p>
        <strong>About:</strong> The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed account of how the RDS role can be
        installed and licensed (through the retail channel, your situation may differ) on a non-domain joined (member of
        a workgroup) Server 2012R2, as this scenario is apparently not officially supported by Microsoft: the
        centralized GUI console for RDS management, called the Remote Desktop Management Services, or RDMS, requires
        that the administrator account that launches it be a a domain account (and so the server to a member of an
        Active Directory domain), otherwise it will not work. The document's instructions also ensure that the RDS
        deployment is reasonably hardened: RDP connections are secured via the use of NLA and encryption (optimally with
        a root CA-issued certificate, otherwise with a self-signed one, automatically generated by the RDS).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How-to:</strong> There are two ways of achieving the goal, either by using the CLI or by using the GUI;
        they are detailed below. Both paths assume that you are logged in with the Administrator account and both have a
        <em>Prerequisites</em> section, which is provided only in the CLI form (note that you must always go through the
        <em>Prerequisites</em> section before continuing on to the CLI or GUI sections).

          <summary>Prerequisites</summary>
          <p>- run the below commands from an elevated Powershell console:</p>
          <pre><code>#set the hostname
(get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2 -class Win32_ComputerSystem).rename("%enterHostnameHere%") | out-null

#set the FQDN suffix
set-itemProperty -path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters -name "NV Domain" -value "%subdomain.domain.tld%"

#append primary DNS suffix (and derivatives) to DNS requests -- should already be set, but it's better to make sure
set-itemProperty -path HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters -name UseDomainNameDevolution -value 1

#allow Remote Desktop connections to the system
(get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TerminalServiceSetting).setAllowTSConnections(1) | out-null

#set the RDP security layer to SSL (TLSv1.2)
(get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TSGeneralSetting).setSecurityLayer(2) | out-null

#set the RDP encryption level to High -- no WMI method was found to work, so we'll go instead with modifying the registry directly
#(given the subsequent reboot, this should work just fine)
set-itemProperty -path "HKLM:\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Terminal Server\WinStations\RDP-Tcp" -name MinEncryptionLevel -value 3

#enable enforcement of <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc732713%28v=ws.11%29.aspx">NLA</a>-only connections
(get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TSGeneralSetting).setUserAuthenticationRequired(1) | out-null

            - open an elevated Powershell console<br />
            - run the below commands within it:
          </p>
          <pre><code>#install the Remote Desktop Session Host and Remote Desktop Licensing roles on the system (including the management tools for the Licensing role)
  install-windowsFeature -name RDS-RD-Server,RDS-Licensing -includeManagementTools -restart
  #note: the system might automatically reboot in order to finish the role deployment

  #set up and activate the (local) Licensing Server
  $licSrv = get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2 -class Win32_TSLicenseServer
  $licSrv.FirstName = "%your first_name%"
  $licSrv.LastName = "%your last name%"
  $licSrv.CountryRegion = "%your country of residence%"
  $licSrv.Company = "%your company's name"

  invoke-wmiMethod -class Win32_TSLicenseServer -name ActivateServerAutomatic -namespace root\CIMv2 | out-null

  #enable the per-user licensing mode for the License Server
  (get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TerminalServiceSetting).changeMode(4) | out-null

  #set the system's licensing server to be the local Licensing Server
  (get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TerminalServiceSetting).setSpecifiedLicenseServerList("$env:computername") | out-null

  #install a License Key Pack (such as a 5-CAL RDS retail license)
  (get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TSLicenseKeyPack).installRetailPurchaseKeyPack("%license_key--see_the_NOTE_below%") | out-null
  *note on the license key: it must be provided without the hyphens (so the 5 groups of 5 characters each, delimitated with '-' characters, will be provided as a continuous string of 25 alphanumeric characters; don't forget to enclose the resulting string in quotes)
  **example: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-eeeee" must be provided as "aaaaabbbbbcccccdddddeeeee" - the full command will look as below:
  (get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2\TerminalServices -class Win32_TSLicenseKeyPack).installRetailPurchaseKeyPack("aaaaabbbbbcccccdddddeeeee") | out-null</code></pre>
          <p>- you should be all done at this point</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Pinch of salt warning - the above steps have never been fully tested, since the
            installation of the CALs has not been possible in the environment used to compile the steps, so the mileage
            may vary.

            <li>open the 'Server Manager'</li>
            <li>go to 'Manage'\'Add Roles and Features' (upper right corner of the window)</li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>
              continue to 'Server Selection', keep the default selection (it will be the local system), then proceed to
              'Server Roles'

            <li>select the 'Remote Desktop Services' role and continue to the 'Features' section</li>

            <li>select the 'Remote Desktop Licensing' and 'Remote Desktop Session Host' functions from the list</li>
            <li>confirm the installation (select the option to automatically restart the server)</li>
          </ul>

            <li>open the 'Server Manager'</li>
            <li>go to 'Tools'\'Terminal Services'\'Remote Desktop Licensing Manager'</li>
            <li>expand 'All servers', right click on the server name\'Activate Server'</li>
            <li>
              select the 'Automatic connection' method (requires that port 443 be open in the firewall leading to the
              Internet)
            </li>
            <li>
              provide the required identification information and activate the server (again, this requires that the
              server be able reach the Internet over port 443)
            </li>
            <li>afterwards right click on the server's name and select 'Install Licenses'</li>
            <li>select 'License Pack (Retail Purchase)' as the license program</li>
            <li>provide the license code(s) by using the input boxes and the click the 'Add' button</li>
            <li>
              once done, hit 'Next'; the Clearinghouse server will be contacted and the RDS CALs will be installed
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>- you should be all done at this point</p>

          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Pinch of salt warning - the GUI steps are written from memory, mainly, so I'm not
            sure how close they follow the actual wizards, the actual mileage may vary.

      <p>
        <strong>Notes</strong> on the 'CLI' and 'Prerequisites' sections: the easiest way of using these sections is to
        copy/paste those commands which do not require any editing into a Powershell console and to use a text editor
        for those commands which include the <em>%your_input_here%</em> type of string, and so do require editing; in
        that case, you must replace the <em>%string%</em> (including the <em>%</em> characters) with the required/needed
        value and then copy/paste the resulting command into the console.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance,
        <code
          >(get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2 -class Win32_ComputerSystem).rename("%enterHostnameHere%") |
          out-null</code
        >
        would be pasted in Powershell, after editing it in Notepad, as:
        <code>(get-wmiObject -namespace root\CIMv2 -class Win32_ComputerSystem).rename("TestServer01") | out-null</code>
