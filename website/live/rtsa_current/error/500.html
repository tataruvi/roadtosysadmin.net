      <h4>At this point, you might consider your likely options to be one of the following:</h4>

      <p>  I. Navigate to one of the below search engines, thus leaving the website.</p>
      <a href="https://www.google.com/ncr">Google</a>
      <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a>
      <a href="https://www.bing.com">Bing</a>

      <p>  II. Take advantage of being online and visit some lovely corners of the Internet, such as:</p>
      <a href="http://tvtropes.org/">TV Tropes</a>
      <a href="http://redlettermedia.com/">RedLetterMedia</a>
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube</a>
      <p class="exclusions">*I'll add more, as inspiration strikes.</p>

      <p>III. Do me the courtesy of reporting the issue, by emailing me at the below address (and including the faulting link, and the time, in the email); I know, I probably wouldn't do this either. Anyhow, here's the address: <br />
